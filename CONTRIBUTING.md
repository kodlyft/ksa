## Code of Conduct

This project follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork into your bench:

   ```bash
   cd $PATH_TO_YOUR_BENCH
   bench get-app https://github.com/<your-username>/ksa --branch develop
   bench --site your-site.com install-app ksa
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote:**

   ```bash
   cd apps/ksa
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kodlyft/ksa.git
   ```

4. **Create a new branch** from `develop`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name develop
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Dependency       | Version  |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Python           | >= 3.14  |
| Node.js          | >= 24    |
| Frappe Framework | v16      |
| ERPNext          | v16 (optional) |

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before every commit:

```bash
cd apps/ksa
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

### Backend Development

```bash
cd $PATH_TO_YOUR_BENCH
bench start       # Start Frappe development server
```

## Making Changes

- Keep changes focused. A single PR should address a single concern.
- Write or update tests for any new functionality.
- Ensure all linters and tests pass before submitting:

  ```bash
  # Python linting
  ruff check ksa/

  # Run the app's unit tests
  bench --site your-site.com run-tests --app ksa
  ```

All commits **must** follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This enables automated versioning and changelog generation.
